                <p>I’m a software engineer and lifelong tinkerer in London, Canada.</p>
                <p>What began as a curiosity in the mid-90s is now a lifelong passion.</p>
                <p>Having begun during the early days of Web 1.0 (<em>do you remember Geocities?</em>), I welcomed Web 2.0 with open arms.</p>
                <p>I designed and built websites, knowing that I could now present my ideas to the world, solving problems along the way. I love bringing people together, and so I built niche online communities.<p>
                <p>I launched a few private communities (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021101213652/http://www.torusforums.com/forums/main.php" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">TorusForums.com</a>), catalogued techno music playlists (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070329110927/http://www.tracklists.ca/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Tracklists.ca</a>), ran a pirate radio station with Shoutcast (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070329110927/http://www.tracklists.ca/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Tracklists.ca</a>), prototyped a music discovery platform (TuneTaster) and so much more along the way.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor in Engineering from The University of Western Ontario in 2006.</p>
                <p>Having spent the first 8 years of my professional career as a JAVA programmer at <a href="https://www.3m.com/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">3M</a>, I joined a scrappy startup, <a href="https://www.tbkcreative.com" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">tbk</a>, as VP Technology in 2013 and have grown the company to be <a href="https://www.tbkcreative.com/our-work/" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">a powerhouse marketing-technology agency</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm a web accessibility expert, having supported many Canadian brands with web accessibility as the VP Technology at <a href="https://www.aodaonline.com" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">AODA Online</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm honoured to be a part of a community that is committed to being <em>ever better</em>.</p>
                <p>I recognize that the web and its opportunities are still inaccessible for many. I'm excited that Web 3.0 is evolving our digital landscape, prioritizing ownership and access to information for all. Web 3.0 will dramatically improve our quality of life. Or maybe not.</p>
                <p>Technology is a curious thing, isn't it?</p>

                <h2>Leisure</h2>
                <p>Along the way, I've had other passions.</p>
                <p>I've been an award-winning home brewer specializing in American IPAs and Belgian style ales. I designed and built a beer discovery application, <a rel="nofollow,noindex" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711055710/https://getcrafty.co/">GetCrafty.co</a>, to help other hop-heads find their favorite beers in Ontario. And then <a href="https://github.com/alefort/getcrafty" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">open-source'd the code</a> for all.</p>
                <p>I was a trance DJ and event organizer (Get Lifted Events). #TranceForLife. Professional photographer? Yup. That too. I've owned and operated 3 different food blogs over the years. nom nom nom.</p>
                <p>I was a competitive distance runner for most of my life, now happily pounding the pavement and nearby trails. Making hand-sculpted, hardwood rock climbing holds for my custom-built bouldering wall? You bet.</p>
                <p>I love being outdoors with my family and <a href="https://www.beingoutdoors.ca" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">blog about it</a>.</p>
                <p>Some days I wish I was a mechatronics engineer. But I'm not. So instead I bridge traditional mediums with technology when I can (<a href="https://github.com/alefort/rpi-temp-logger.js" rel="nofollow,noindex" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Brewing Monitor</a>).</p>
                <p>I've led WordPress and e-Commerce development courses at Fanshawe College in London, having been on several advisory committees to help guide Fanshawe's media design programs.</p>
                <p>Blockchain and crypto assets are a new passion of mine and I am working to apply these new technologies to the health and preservation of our planet.</p>
                <p>If I sound like someone you'd like to collaborate with, reach out. I love meeting other likeminded, problem-solving, growth-focused individuals.</p>
